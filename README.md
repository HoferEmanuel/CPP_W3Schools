# C++_W3Schools
<hr />

### I decided to learn C++ on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)

<hr />

## Why C++?
- I wanted to learn something new but simular to C#.
- I´m thinking about game-development in Unreal. I like the Engine a lot but not Blueprints. Compared to Unity it feels less rewarding when getting done with a System and i hope that learning C++ could change that.
- I´m in love with programming in general and i´m always down to learn a new language.
